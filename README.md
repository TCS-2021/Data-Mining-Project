## GitHub Actions: Code Quality Checks

Our project uses GitHub Actions to automatically run code quality checks on all pull requests. Please ensure your contributions pass these checks before submitting.

### PyLint Code Quality Requirements

All code must pass the following PyLint checks([Reference](https://github.com/sprytnyk/pylint-errors?tab=readme-ov-file)):

#### Basic Checker Requirements
| Code | Description | 
|------|-------------|
| C0103 | Use valid and descriptive variable/function names |
| C0112 | Don't use empty docstrings |
| C0114 | Include module docstrings |
| C0116 | Include function docstrings |
| E0102 | Avoid function redefinition |
| R5501 | Use `elif` instead of `else` followed by `if` |
| C0301 | Keep lines within reasonable length |
| E0108 | Don't use duplicate argument names |

#### Import Style Requirements
| Code | Description |
|------|-------------|
| C0410 | Avoid multiple imports on the same line |
| W0611 | Remove unused imports |
| C0411 | Follow proper import order |
| C0415 | Place imports at the top of the file |

#### Code Duplication Check
| Code | Description |
|------|-------------|
| R0801 | Avoid duplicate code |

#### Refactoring Requirements
| Code | Description |
|------|-------------|
| R1714 | Use `in` operator when appropriate |
| W0612 | Remove unused variables |
| W0613 | Remove unused function arguments |
| W0614 | Avoid unused wildcard imports |

### PyTest Requirements

Try achieving a coverage score >80. 

These checks help maintain code quality and consistency throughout the project. Pull requests failing these checks will need revision before merging.

Please use the valid channel on [discussions tab](https://github.com/TCS-2021/Data-Mining-Project/discussions) for any other queries.

## Guide: Creating a Branch and Working in Git

### 1. Check the Current Branch
Before creating a new branch, check your current branch:
```sh
git branch
```

### 2. Create a New Branch
Use the following command to create a new branch:
```sh
git checkout -b my-feature-branch
```
OR
```sh
git switch -c my-feature-branch
```
This creates and switches to the new branch.

### 3. Make Changes and Stage Them
Edit your files, then stage them:
```sh
git add filename
```
Or stage all changes:
```sh
git add .
```

### 4. Commit the Changes (with a commit message)
```sh
git commit -m "Added new feature"
```

### 5. Push the Branch to Remote Repository
Push the branch to GitHub:
```sh
git push origin my-feature-branch
```

### 6. Create a Pull Request (PR)
1. Go to your GitHub repository.
2. Click on **Pull Requests** â†’ **New Pull Request**.
3. Select your branch and compare it with `main`.
4. Add a title, description, and submit the PR.

### 7. Switch Back to `main` (If Needed)
Once done, switch back to the main branch:
```sh
git switch main
```
OR  
```sh
git checkout main
```
Update it with the latest changes:
```sh
git pull origin main
```
